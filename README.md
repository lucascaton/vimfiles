# Vimfiles by Lucas Caton

**Vimfiles** are configuration files for the Vim editor. It includes editor preferences, colorscheme and font definitions, plugins, custom functions and more.

**This project is my personal Vimfiles**. Feel free to send me suggestions through the [issues page](https://github.com/hevertonrodrigues/vimfiles/issues/new) or to send me improvements through the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/lucascaton/vimfiles/pulls).

## How to use these vim configs

Clone this repository into your home directory as `~/.vim` and then install the plugins. Such as:

    git clone git://github.com/hevertonrodrigues/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule update --init
    cp fonts/Monaco+for+Powerline.otf ~/Library/Fonts/

Install jshint, in order to review your javascript files:

    sudo npm install -g jshint

## Colorscheme

* ir_black

## Fonts

These are my favorite fonts:

* Monaco *(my current one)*
* Anonymous Pro
* Inconsolata-dz
* Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
